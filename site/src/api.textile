h2. The API

If you haven't yet read the "adapters":adapters.html page, now is the perfect time.

These methods are king:

  * owner
  * clauses
  * stash

@owner@ is the class from which the request was generated.

<ruby>
User.select { |u| u.name == 'Pork' }
# => owner == User
</ruby>

@clauses@ is the hash of translated arrays, keyed by processors

<ruby>
User.select { |u| u.name == 'Pork' }
# => clauses ==  { :select => [ "users.name = 'Pork'" ] }
</ruby>

@stash@ is your personal private stash.  A hash you can use for
keeping stuff around.

<ruby>
User.select { |u| u.profile.name == 'Pork' }
# => stash == { :include => [ :profile ] }
</ruby>

The above is totally arbitrary.  It's basically a way for your
translators to talk to each other and, more importantly, to the Query
object.
