# This is where you inject Ambition into your target.
#
# Use `extend' if you are injecting a class, `include' if you are
# injecting instances of that class.
#
# You must also set the `ambition_adapter' class variable on your target
# class, regardless of whether you are injecting instances or the class itself.
#
# You probably want something like this:
#
#   <%= adapter_module %>::Base.extend Ambition::API
#   <%= adapter_module %>::Base.ambition_adapter = Ambition::Adapters::<%= adapter_module %>
#
